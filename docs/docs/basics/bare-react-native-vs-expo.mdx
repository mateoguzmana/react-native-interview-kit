# Bare React Native vs Expo

## Should you use Bare React Native or Expo?

This question comes around often in social media and forums.

It used to be a very opinionated question as in the past Expo lacked certain capabilities which made it limited in many aspects, but as of now in 2024, Expo is pretty mature and flexible, and offers many benefits that speed up the development process.

Expo is also recommended by the React Native team in the [official docs](https://reactnative.dev/).

Some personal opinions about Expo and why I would use it whenever I have the chance:

- **Libraries**: Expo has a lot well maintained libraries that work well in different platforms (most of the time web, Android & iOS), supported by the Expo team.
- **Development Builds using expo-dev-client**: While keeping all the main benefits of Expo, It is their most flexible alternative as it allows you to install any native library and this opens the limitations that Expo used to have.
- **Upgrades**: Expo team is always updating the libraries and the CLI, so you can be sure that you will have the latest features and bug fixes of React Native. It is a massive advantage because normally upgrading React Native is difficult and Expo makes this really easy.
- **Expo Modules API**: Expo offers a very easy way to integrate custom native code into your app. Which makes it really easy even if you are not very proficient in native code.
