# Flutter or React Native?

## Which framework is better Flutter or React Native?

It depends on the project requirements and the developer's skill set. But in short, React Native would be a better choice for web developers who are already familiar with React.

And also if you want to attract a larger audience, React Native is a better choice because it has been around longer and has a larger community. Also uses TypeScript, which is has a larger community than Dart.

With React Native you can target many platforms with a single codebase. More than the platforms that Flutter supports.
