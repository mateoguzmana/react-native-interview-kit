Interview Kit for React Native

This is a collection of examples, exercises and questions that can be used to prepare for a React Native interview. Either as an interviewer, if you are looking to hire a React Native developer, or as an interviewee, if you are looking to get hired as a React Native developer.

Background: I have been working with React Native for a few years now and have been involved in the hiring process for React Native developers. I have found that there is a lack of resources available to help prepare for React Native interviews. This repository is an attempt to fill that gap.

I have also done several interviews myself and have found that the questions and exercises in this repository are a good representation of the types of questions that are asked during React Native interviews.

## Features

- **Questions**: A collection of questions that can be asked during a React Native interview.

- **Exercises**: A collection of exercises that can be used to test the React Native skills of a candidate.

## For Interviewers

Depending on your use case, the purpose of this kit is also that you can fork this repository and customize it to suit your needs. You can add your own questions, exercises, and examples to the kit and then use it for interviews.

## For Interviewees

If you are preparing for a React Native interview, you can use this kit to practice and prepare for the interview. You can go through the questions, exercises, and examples in this kit to get a better understanding of what to expect during the interview.

## Installation

Some parts of this kit are also available as an NPM package, so you can create your own lists, tests or whatever you need with this content. This is built as a package just for the purpose of use this in different ways and not only for reading. You can install it using the following command:

```sh
npm install react-native-interview-kit
```
